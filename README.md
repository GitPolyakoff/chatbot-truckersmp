# TMP Chat Bot

A simple chat bot for **TruckersMP** (ETS2 / ATS).  
This bot reads your chat log file and can respond with useful commands.  
It also connects to **Groq API (LLaMA model)** for AI answers.

## ✨ Features
- `!gpt <text>` → ask AI (LLaMA model via Groq API). The bot will answer in the same language as the question.  
- Works inside the TruckersMP chat (reads the log file).  
- Filters messages using a **banned words list** to prevent inappropriate content.  
- Lightweight and easy to use.

## 🚀 Usage

1. Download the following files:
   - `tmp-bot.exe`
   - `banned_words.txt`

2. Place both files in the same folder (recommended: Desktop).

3. Run `tmp-bot.exe`.

4. On first launch, the app will ask for:
   - **Groq API key** (create one at [Groq Console](https://console.groq.com/keys))
   - **Path to `banned_words.txt`**  
     Example:
     ```
     C:\Users\YourName\Desktop\banned_words.txt
     ```

5. The app will save this configuration automatically. On subsequent launches, no input is required.

## 📌 Notes

- Answers from GPT are short (1–2 sentences), because game chat has limited space.

- The bot only works while the log file is updating (so you must be in TruckersMP).

- The app automatically saves the API key and banned words path on first launch for future use.
